        <h1>Rover Homepage Vision</h1>

        <section>
	        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
	        <p>
	        In 2019, I partnered with another designer to create a north star vision for the Rover homepage. Our task was to consider the issues we faced today, and potential challenges of the future, to build a long term vision for our first and most crucial touchpoint in the Rover experience. Here you’ll find our step by step process to reinvent Rover’s most crucial page. 
	        </p>
	      </section>

	          position="left"
	          label="UX pain point: Multiple location inputs and calls to action on the homepage"
	        />

	        <h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
	        <p>  	 	 						
	        The current homepage was a confusing experience. Different teams and business objectives competed for real estate. Our customers had to decide between several competing entry points. Visitors had only a few seconds to understand what Rover is and if Rover would solve their problems. In that time we struggled to communicate our value and why visitors should trust us. 
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        We also catalogued specific UX pain points, such as service selection that didn’t scale, a divergent mobile experience, no predetermined spot to promote new services and deals and each market specific service needing its own location input (ie: Dog Grooming available only in Seattle). 
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        Our goal was to bring clarity to the home page, funnel new visitors to the first step of the service they need and launch returning customers toward the tasks they need to complete while suggesting services personalized to them. 
	       	</p>

	      </section>

	      <section>

	        <h2>Home page requirements</h2>
	        <p>
	        We created the following requirements that our new homepage vision would have to include. 
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        <ul className="numbered-list">
		        	<li>
			        Customers should be able to look at the home page for 5 seconds and have a clear understanding of what Rover is.
			        </li>
			        <li> 
			        Create a framework for what gets a place (or doesn’t) on the home page such as promoting new services or ongoing marketing campaigns
			        </li>
			        <li>
			        Create a scalable solution for our growing suite of services and future product offerings.
			        </li>
			        <li>
			        Be clearly inclusive to all the pets we support
			        </li>
			        <li>
			        Use the data we have on all our visitors to personalize the product experience.
			        </li>
			      </ul> 
		      </p>

	          label="Scenario Mapping flows joined into one user journey flow chart"
	        />

	        <h2>Research & Validation</h2>
	        <p>
	        To learn more about the scope of our problem and potential solutions, we undertook an extensive research phase. We started by conducting 13 stakeholder interviews across every line of business at Rover to align everyone prior to starting work. We did competitor homepage analysis on more than 15 marketplace sites such as airbnb, care, taskrabbit, wag, seatgeek, stubhub and fiver just to name a few. We conducted user testing on the current home page including 5 second tests to measure first impressions. We did a scenario mapping exercise for new and returning customers to capture questions, comment, ideas and opportunities at every step of our funnel, that we could then use to influence our messaging and UX decisions on the home page. 
	        </p> 

	        

	        <p>
	        After researching, we led a design workshop with our fellow designers and product managers to gather ideas and sketch homepage concepts. We then wireframed and refined those concepts, before user testing 7 concepts to test their usability and how effectively we were building trust. From there we continued to refine the designs with 2 more rounds of user testing that touched the desktop, mobile and native platforms. All in all we conducted 56 rounds of user testing before landing on a final north star vision. 
	        </p>

	        <h2>What we learned</h2>
	        <InlineImage 
	          src="https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/case-study/homepage-vision/rover_homepage_vision_highlight_testimonials.jpg"
	          position="right"
	          label="The north star testimonial design"
	        />
	        <h4>Testimonials</h4>
	        
	        <p>
	      	Testimonials are integral to trust. They were the most referenced element when we asked what made our site trustworthy. Customers asked for them when we didn’t include them and didn’t believe claims related to stay quality when not accompanied by reviews. We normally showed one review, but moving to several reviews featuring different pet types and services, made the reviews more believable and helped customers such as cat owners, who normally did not see targeted trust messaging. Highlighting background checks, sitter quality claims (ex: this sitter was reviewed by a team of specialists) and a professional design also moved the needle on trust building. In our last 2 rounds of user testing we asked “Would you describe this site as trustworthy?” and 20/20 users said yes.

	      	<InlineImage 
	          src="https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/case-study/homepage-vision/rover_homepage_vision_highlight_search_bar.jpg"
	          position="left"
	          label="The north star unified search bar"
	        />

	        <h4>Unified Search Bar</h4>
	        
	      	<p>
	      	When it came to selecting a service, a unified search bar was the most intuitive entry point we discovered for our growing suit of services. It matched customer expectations and helped communicate that ‘Rover does it all’. It would allow us to create a persistent entry point that could be easily reused across the product in locations such as the header. With a search bar we could present custom results based on user queries, letting us untether services from their strict naming conventions. A user searching for ‘Cat Hotel’ in Ohio or ‘Dog Minding’ in Australia, could both be routed to the ‘Boarding’ funnel, without us changing our top of funnel messaging.

	      	<InlineImage 
	          src="https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/case-study/homepage-vision/rover_homepage_vision_highlight_discovery_section.jpg"
	          position="right"
	          label="The north star discovery section"
	        />

	        <h4>Discovery Section</h4>
	        
	      	<p>
	      	Finally we had great success in adding ‘Discovery’ content that highlighted new services, special promotional offers and our hugely successful blog content that traditionally had no presence in our marketplace product. We found this content made us an all inclusive authority on pets. Showcasing useful pet care information demonstrates that we are more than service, and gave users without an immediate need a reason to return to Rover. As one customer put it, this “Shows how well rounded Rover is, more than just a service”
	      	</p>

	        <h2>Content Framework</h2>

	        <p>
	      	One of the most crucial elements of the project was proposing a content framework for what would live on the Rover homepage. The current Rover homepage had suffered from gradual ‘barnacling’ over the years as different teams led individual initiatives to get their projects represented on the homepage. This resulted in an unoptimized, inconsistent experience that varied wildly depending on what market you were in, and what platform you were interacting on. To solve this we would need to propose guidelines that gave individual teams and markets the space and opportunity to customize as they saw fit, without disrupting other initiatives or creating divergent experiences. Here’s a few highlights from this content framework. 
	      	</p>
	      	<p>
		      	<ul className="bullet-list">
		      		<li>
			        Allowing the hero image and headline to be altered in individual markets, crucial for localizing the homepage in international markets. 
			        </li>
			        <li>
			        Allowing the order of services in the service selector to change, so it can be optimized by market or rearranged to prioritize recently used services.
			        </li>
			        <li>
			        Creating a discovery section for highlighting up to 2 items that could be customized for each market, including new products and services, promotional deals and time constrained searches such as dog boarding over the 4th of July (holidays are some of Rovers busiest times)
			        </li>
			        <li>
			        Creating a space in the discovery section to highlight 4 pieces of content such as popular blog articles or press packages, that would be updated on a more frequent basis. 
			       	</li>
			       	<li>
			        Allowing testimonials to be altered by country and market, allowing further localization in international markets. 
			        </li>
			      </ul>

	        <h2>The Final Vision</h2>
	        <p>
	        After completing all this work, we presented a final high fidelity north star vision to a large cross section of the product team. You can view the final presentation here, and view the final north star design below.

	        <h2>Launching the Test</h2>
	        <p>
	        Knowing this was a sizable project that would not be completed at once, we had prioritized several key initiatives that we were most confident in based on the research. In Fall 2019 we started work on the first Homepage update based on our North Star Vision which included the following changes. 
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        <ul className="bullet-list">
		        	<li>
			        A new consolidated service selector that used a single location input to determine which services to show, and created a single, clear call to action to enter the funnel. 
			        </li>
			        <li>
			        Updated service descriptions that focused on what the service is, whether it was offered in the sitters or owners home, and a value prop for how it might benefit the customer. 
			        </li>
			        <li>
			        An updated testimonial section with 2 new customer testimonials detailing both a dog and cat stay on Rover. 
			        Results
			        </li>
			      </ul>

		      <h2>Results</h2>

		      <p>
	        For testing our primary objectives were to reduce bounce rate on the homepage and increase the number of users who navigated from homepage to search. The mobile test won handily, reducing bounce by 9% and increasing homepage to search from 32% to 35%. Unfortunately the desktop test was inconclusive due to technical problems that prevented us from accurately measuring bounce rate. A followup desktop test was in the process of being prioritized when the COVID-19 outbreak hit and altered our roadmaps. 
	       	</p>
	       	<p>
	        From a personal growth perspective, this project was an incredible learning experience that allowed me to refine my skills on a large project that demanded a high level of research and due diligence, and that required the buy in of a large, diverse group of stakeholders. This project was called out specifically in my 2019 performance review. <i>“… the Homepage Vision work was an excellent demonstration of your ability to take on an ambiguous, extra-large size project, keep it on track, and deliver results, even without PM support for most of the effort … the fact that you and [my design partner] were able to get a large group of stakeholders from across the business aligned on a single solution is a demonstration of your ability to collaborate, to influence, and to deliver a high quality solution that others (representing a variety of teams and needs) are willing to buy into.” (2019 Review)</i>

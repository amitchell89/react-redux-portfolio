The current Rover homepage had suffered from gradual \\u2018barnacling\\u2019 over the years as different teams led individual initiatives to get their projects represented on the homepage. This resulted in an unoptimized, inconsistent experience that varied wildly depending on what market you were in, and what platform you were interacting on.

This change in project prioritization was one of my biggest achievements in the growth space. \\u201C...

The sitter profile was performing significantly worse on mobile web than on desktop or our native apps.

Knowing this, we redesigned the information architecture on the page to prioritize these two pieces of information first, so users would see what they needed immediately and spend less time hunting on the page. We then did a general cleanup on the page, reducing redundancy and grouping similar content together. This allowed us to also design a followup test that added navigation to the page, similar to our mobile apps, so that users could quickly navigate to the section most relevant to them.'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t),\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t_react2.default.createElement(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'p',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnull,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'We launched an A/B/C test with two content variants to determine if reviews or a short biography would perform better as the lead item on the profile. Both variants outperformed the control, with the biography variant being the most successful. This matched our expectations, as it was a warmed intro to \\u2018hear from the sitter\\u2019 before you read their reviews. We then conducted the followup test that added navigation to the page, which also won. The combined projects led to a 2% overall increase in Search to Book conversion.

This was different from our web experience, which let users search for sitters and view their profiles without having to sign up.   Our hypothesis was that if we allowed users to navigate the app, in a similar fashion to our web experience, less users would bounce after downloading the app, and more users would convert and book a Rover service.'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t),\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t_react2.default.createElement(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'p',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnull,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'To start this project, I mapped out the entire Rover app experience in a flowchart so we could evaluate each view and determine whether it should be accessible to an unauthenticated customer. I began marking different views as green, to keep, or red, to hide behind authentication. This quickly created a visual representation of what the project would look like that we could discuss with the developers to begin planning the backend infrastructure requirements before I had even started designing. This was a crucial step in saving us time and reducing scope, as the developers could weigh in on the effort of allowing access to each view. Once we had finalized the new unauthenticated site map, I designed the UX changes, which focused on updating the authentication screens, and removing inaccessible navigation items across the app. I then produced a high fidelity spec which merged these UX changes with the sitemap to create a working document for the developers to reference.'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t),\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t_react2.default.createElement(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'p',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnull,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'The first moment of success for me was in the bug bash prior to launch, We had no significant issues come up which was a testament to the close collaboration we had with the developers starting at kickoff, and helped us get this project out the door on schedule.

In that time we struggled to communicate our value and why visitors should trust us. \n\t        </p>\n\t        <p>\n\t        We also catalogued specific UX pain points, such as service selection that didn’t scale, a divergent mobile experience, no predetermined spot to promote new services and deals and each market specific service needing its own location input (ie: Dog Grooming available only in Seattle). \n\t        </p>\n\t        <p>\n\t        Our goal was to bring clarity to the home page, funnel new visitors to the first step of the service they need and launch returning customers toward the tasks they need to complete while suggesting services personalized to them. \n\t       \t</p>\n\n\t      </section>\n\n\t      <section>\n\n\t        <h2>Home page Requirements</h2>\n\t        <p>\n\t        We created the following requirements that our new homepage vision would have to include. \n\t        </p>\n\t        <p>\n\t\t        <ul className=\"numbered-list\">\n\t\t        \t<li>\n\t\t\t        Customers should be able to look at the home page for 5 seconds and have a clear understanding of what Rover is.\n\t\t\t        </li>\n\t\t\t        <li> \n\t\t\t        Create a framework for what gets a place (or doesn’t) on the home page such as promoting new services or ongoing marketing campaigns\n\t\t\t        </li>\n\t\t\t        <li>\n\t\t\t        Create a scalable solution for our growing suite of services and future product offerings.\n\t\t\t        </li>\n\t\t\t        <li>\n\t\t\t        Be clearly inclusive to all the pets we support\n\t\t\t        </li>\n\t\t\t        <li>\n\t\t\t        Use the data we have on all our visitors to personalize the product experience.\n\t\t\t        </li>\n\t\t\t      </ul> \n\t\t      </p>\n\n\t\t    </section>\n\n\t\t    <section>\n\n\t\t      <InlineImage \n\t          src=\"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/case-study/homepage-vision/rover_homepage_scenario_mapping.jpg\"\n\t          position=\"right\"\n\t          label=\"Scenario Mapping Exercise\"\n\t        />\n\n\t        <InlineImage \n\t          src=\"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/case-study/homepage-vision/rover_homepage_vision_user_journey_flow.png\"\n\t          position=\"right\"\n\t          label=\"Scenario Mapping flows joined into one user journey flow chart\"\n\t        />\n\n\t        <h2>Research & Validation</h2>\n\t        <p>\n\t        To learn more about the scope of our problem and potential solutions, we undertook an extensive research phase. We started by conducting 13 stakeholder interviews across every line of business at Rover to align everyone prior to starting work. We did competitor homepage analysis on more than 15 marketplace sites such as airbnb, care, taskrabbit, wag, seatgeek, stubhub and fiver just to name a few. We conducted user testing on the current home page including 5 second tests to measure first impressions. We did a scenario mapping exercise for new and returning customers to capture questions, comment, ideas and opportunities at every step of our funnel, that we could then use to influence our messaging and UX decisions on the home page. \n\t        </p> \n\n\t        \n\n\t        <p>\n\t        After researching, we led a design workshop with our fellow designers and product managers to gather ideas and sketch homepage concepts. We then wireframed and refined those concepts, before user testing 7 concepts to test their usability and how effectively we were building trust. From there we continued to refine the designs with 2 more rounds of user testing that touched the desktop, mobile and native platforms. All in all we conducted 56 rounds of user testing before landing on a final north star vision. \n\t        </p>\n\n\t      </section>\n\n\t      <section>\n\t\t      <InlineImage \n\t\t        src=\"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/case-study/homepage-vision/rover_homepage_vision_concept_sketching_workshop.jpg\"\n\t\t        position=\"full\"\n\t\t        label=\"Homepage concept sketching design workshop\"\n\t\t      />\n\t      </section>\n\n\t      <section>\n\n\t        <h2>What we learned</h2>\n\t        <InlineImage \n\t          src=\"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/case-study/homepage-vision/rover_homepage_vision_highlight_testimonials.jpg\"\n\t          position=\"right\"\n\t          label=\"The north star testimonial design\"\n\t        />\n\t        <h4>Testimonials</h4>\n\t        \n\t        <p>\n\t      \tTestimonials are integral to trust. They were the most referenced element when we asked what made our site trustworthy. Customers asked for them when we didn’t include them and didn’t believe claims related to stay quality when not accompanied by reviews. We normally showed one review, but moving to several reviews featuring different pet types and services, made the reviews more believable and helped customers such as cat owners, who normally did not see targeted trust messaging. Highlighting background checks, sitter quality claims (ex: this sitter was reviewed by a team of specialists) and a professional design also moved the needle on trust building. In our last 2 rounds of user testing we asked “Would you describe this site as trustworthy?” and 20/20 users said yes.\t\n\t      \t</p>\n\t      \t<InlineImage \n\t          src=\"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/case-study/homepage-vision/rover_homepage_vision_highlight_search_bar.jpg\"\n\t          position=\"left\"\n\t          label=\"The north star unified search bar\"\n\t        />\n\n\t        <h4>Unified Search Bar</h4>\n\t        \n\t      \t<p>\n\t      \tWhen it came to selecting a service, a unified search bar was the most intuitive entry point we discovered for our growing suit of services. It matched customer expectations and helped communicate that ‘Rover does it all’. It would allow us to create a persistent entry point that could be easily reused across the product in locations such as the header. With a search bar we could present custom results based on user queries, letting us untether services from their strict naming conventions. A user searching for ‘Cat Hotel’ in Ohio or ‘Dog Minding’ in Australia, could both be routed to the ‘Boarding’ funnel, without us changing our top of funnel messaging. \n\t      \t</p>\n\t      \t<InlineImage \n\t          src=\"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/case-study/homepage-vision/rover_homepage_vision_highlight_discovery_section.jpg\"\n\t          position=\"right\"\n\t          label=\"The north star discovery section\"\n\t        />\n\n\t        <h4>Discovery Section</h4>\n\t        \n\t      \t<p>\n\t      \tFinally we had great success in adding ‘Discovery’ content that highlighted new services, special promotional offers and our hugely successful blog content that traditionally had no presence in our marketplace product. We found this content made us an all inclusive authority on pets. Showcasing useful pet care information demonstrates that we are more than service, and gave users without an immediate need a reason to return to Rover. As one customer put it, this “Shows how well rounded Rover is, more than just a service”\n\t      \t</p>\n\n\n\t      </section>\n\n\t      <section>\n\t        <h2>Content Framework</h2>\n\n\t        <p>\n\t      \tOne of the most crucial elements of the project was proposing a content framework for what would live on the Rover homepage. The current Rover homepage had suffered from gradual ‘barnacling’ over the years as different teams led individual initiatives to get their projects represented on the homepage. This resulted in an unoptimized, inconsistent experience that varied wildly depending on what market you were in, and what platform you were interacting on. To solve this we would need to propose guidelines that gave individual teams and markets the space and opportunity to customize as they saw fit, without disrupting other initiatives or creating divergent experiences. Here’s a few highlights from this content framework. \n\t      \t</p>\n\t      \t<p>\n\t\t      \t<ul className=\"bullet-list\">\n\t\t      \t\t<li>\n\t\t\t        Allowing the hero image and headline to be altered in individual markets, crucial for localizing the homepage in international markets. \n\t\t\t        </li>\n\t\t\t        <li>\n\t\t\t        Allowing the order of services in the service selector to change, so it can be optimized by market or rearranged to prioritize recently used services.\n\t\t\t        </li>\n\t\t\t        <li>\n\t\t\t        Creating a discovery section for highlighting up to 2 items that could be customized for each market, including new products and services, promotional deals and time constrained searches such as dog boarding over the 4th of July (holidays are some of Rovers busiest times)\n\t\t\t        </li>\n\t\t\t        <li>\n\t\t\t        Creating a space in the discovery section to highlight 4 pieces of content such as popular blog articles or press packages, that would be updated on a more frequent basis. \n\t\t\t       \t</li>\n\t\t\t       \t<li>\n\t\t\t        Allowing testimonials to be altered by country and market, allowing further localization in international markets. \n\t\t\t        </li>\n\t\t\t      </ul>\n\t\t      </p>\n\n\t\t    </section>\n\n\t\t    <section>\n\n\t        <h2>The Final Vision</h2>\n\t        <p>\n\t        After completing all this work, we presented a final high fidelity north star vision to a large cross section of the product team.

The mobile test won handily, reducing bounce by 9% and increasing homepage to search from 32% to 35%. Unfortunately the desktop test was inconclusive due to technical problems that prevented us from accurately measuring bounce rate. A followup desktop test was in the process of being prioritized when the COVID-19 outbreak hit and altered our roadmaps. \n\t       \t</p>\n\t       \t<p>\n\t        From a personal growth perspective, this project was an incredible learning experience that allowed me to refine my skills on a large project that demanded a high level of research and due diligence, and that required the buy in of a large, diverse group of stakeholders. This project was called out specifically in my 2019 performance review. <i>“… the Homepage Vision work was an excellent demonstration of your ability to take on an ambiguous, extra-large size project, keep it on track, and deliver results, even without PM support for most of the effort … the fact that you and [my design partner] were able to get a large group of stakeholders from across the business aligned on a single solution is a demonstration of your ability to collaborate, to influence, and to deliver a high quality solution that others (representing a variety of teams and needs) are willing to buy into.” (2019 Review)</i>\n\t        </p>\n\n\t      </section>\n\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/Content/CaseStudy/RoverHomepageVision/RoverHomepageVision.js","import React, {Component} from 'react';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router';\n\nexport default class InlineImage extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n\n    const { src, label, position } = this.props;\n\n    let positionClass = null;\n\n    if (position === 'left') {\n      positionClass = 'inline-image inline-image--left';\n    }\n    else if (position === 'right') {\n      positionClass = 'inline-image inline-image--right';\n    } \n    else if (position === 'full') {\n      positionClass = 'inline-image inline-image--full-width';\n    } \n    else {\n      positionClass = 'inline-image';\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <div className={positionClass}>\n        <img src={src} />\n        <p>{label}</p>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/Global/InlineImage/InlineImage.js","import React, {Component} from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n\nimport InlineImage from '../../../Global/InlineImage';\n\nexport default class RoverCRO extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"RoverCRO case-study-images\">\n\n        <h1>Rover Growth & CRO</h1>\n\n        <section>\n\n        \t<h2>Building a Roadmap</h2>\n\n\t        <InlineImage \n\t\t        src=\"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/case-study/cro/rover_cro_scenario_mapping.jpg\"\n\t\t        position=\"right\"\n\t\t        label=\"CRO Research: Funnel Scenario Mapping\"\n\t\t      />\n\n\t        <p>\n\t        Through almost all of my tenure at Rover I have been the primary designer on the growth team which is focused on increasing new bookings through Conversion Rate Optimization, Search Engine Optimization and User Referral initiatives. In August 2019 Rover hired a dedicated CRO project manager. This created an opportunity for the product manager and I to completely reassess our core funnel and prioritize a research driven roadmap that put the needs of our customer first. This change in project prioritization was one of my biggest achievements in the growth space. “... [Aaron] transformed the way the Growth PM team works with UX and approaches work … taking the Growth product space from a fairly reactive one, to a more customer focused, strategic product space.” (2019 Review)\n\t        </p>\n\t        <p>\n\t        We started with an extensive research phase that combined scenario mapping, user testing, customer interviews and existing research to learn what drives our customer at every step of the funnel. We identified an extensive list of issues and potential opportunities, which we then prioritized based on the opportunity size. We primarily focused on mobile web, a platform which saw some of the lowest conversion numbers on Rover despite our best efforts to be a mobile first company. \n\t        </p>\n\t        <p>\n\t        Here are a few of the many Growth projects I worked on. \n\t        </p>\n\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n\n\t        <h2>Mobile Web Profile - Reorganize content and add Navigation</h2>\n\n\t        <p>\n\t        Our first priority was looking at the pet sitter profile, which is a crucial step for the customer to evaluate sitters and determine if they are willing to leave their pets in the sitters care. The sitter profile was performing significantly worse on mobile web than on desktop or our native apps. With a majority of our web traffic coming on mobile, it’s underperformance was a huge opportunity for optimization. \n\t        </p>\n\n\t        <InlineImage \n\t\t        src=\"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/case-study/cro/rover_cro_profile_update_navigation.jpg\"\n\t\t        position=\"left\"\n\t\t        label=\"Left: Leading with the about section. Right: Profile Navigation\"\n\t\t      />\n\t\t      \n\t        <p>\n\t        Our hypothesis was that the content on the mobile web profile was incredibly long, unorganized and frankly hadn’t been considered in any meaningful way. The layout was primarily dictated by the fact that the desktop sidebar was placed above the main content on mobile. Also the information architecture was inconsistent, content that should be grouped together wasn’t, meaning users would have to hunt on the page to find what they were looking for. \n\t        </p>\n\t        <p>\n\t        In our user research we learned that the two most important factors in the customer’s decision making process were reviews from other customers, and the sitters biography, which gave them a look at their character and pet care style. Knowing this, we redesigned the information architecture on the page to prioritize these two pieces of information first, so users would see what they needed immediately and spend less time hunting on the page. We then did a general cleanup on the page, reducing redundancy and grouping similar content together. This allowed us to also design a followup test that added navigation to the page, similar to our mobile apps, so that users could quickly navigate to the section most relevant to them. \n\t        </p>\n\t        <p>\n\t        We launched an A/B/C test with two content variants to determine if reviews or a short biography would perform better as the lead item on the profile. Both variants outperformed the control, with the biography variant being the most successful. This matched our expectations, as it was a warmed intro to ‘hear from the sitter’ before you read their reviews. We then conducted the followup test that added navigation to the page, which also won. The combined projects led to a 2% overall increase in Search to Book conversion. The lift was even higher at 3% for new non-authorized users. \n\t        </p>\n\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n\n\t        <h2>Logged Out App Experience</h2>\n\n\t        <InlineImage \n\t\t        src=\"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/case-study/cro/rover_logged_out_app_experience_flow_chart.png\"\n\t\t        position=\"right\"\n\t\t        label=\"The logged out experience flow chart\"\n\t\t      />\n\n\t        <p>\n\t        Traditionally, our native apps had featured an authentication wall immediately upon opening the app, forcing users to commit to giving us their personal information before they’d learned about what Rover is and what services we offer. This was different from our web experience, which let users search for sitters and view their profiles without having to sign up.   Our hypothesis was that if we allowed users to navigate the app, in a similar fashion to our web experience, less users would bounce after downloading the app, and more users would convert and book a Rover service. \n\t       \t</p>\n\t       \t<p> \n\t      \tTo start this project, I mapped out the entire Rover app experience in a flowchart so we could evaluate each view and determine whether it should be accessible to an unauthenticated customer. I began marking different views as green, to keep, or red, to hide behind authentication. This quickly created a visual representation of what the project would look like that we could discuss with the developers to begin planning the backend infrastructure requirements before I had even started designing. This was a crucial step in saving us time and reducing scope, as the developers could weigh in on the effort of allowing access to each view. Once we had finalized the new unauthenticated site map, I designed the UX changes, which focused on updating the authentication screens, and removing inaccessible navigation items across the app. I then produced a high fidelity spec which merged these UX changes with the sitemap to create a working document for the developers to reference. \n\t      \t</p>\n\t      \t<p>\n\t      \tThe first moment of success for me was in the bug bash prior to launch, We had no significant issues come up which was a testament to the close collaboration we had with the developers starting at kickoff, and helped us get this project out the door on schedule. The test was also a success, as we saw the ‘Install to Book’ Metric rise from 4.52% to 4.69%, allowing us to deploy the change to 100% of users in March 2020. \n\t      \t</p>\n\n\t      </section>\n\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/Content/CaseStudy/RoverCRO/RoverCRO.js","import React, {Component} from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router';\nimport Helmet from \"react-helmet\";\n\nimport HomeAbout from '../../components/Content/HomeAbout';\nimport HomeHero from '../../components/Content/HomeHero';\nimport BackgroundShapes from '../../components/Content/BackgroundShapes';\nimport GalleryHome from '../../components/Gallery/GalleryHome';\nimport GalleryHomeCaseStudy from '../../components/Gallery/GalleryHomeCaseStudy';\n\nexport default class Home extends Component {\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener('scroll', this.handleScroll, true);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener('scroll', this.handleScroll);\n  }\n\n  // Reduce shape opacity on scroll\n  handleScroll = () => {\n    var scroll = window.pageYOffset || document.documentElement.scrollTop || document.body.scrollTop || 0;\n    var opacity = -scroll/700 + 2;\n\n    document.getElementById('BackgroundShapes').style.opacity = opacity;\n  };\n\n  render() {\n\n    const gallery = [\n      {\n        name: \"Web Development\",\n        url: \"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/projects/covers/react_logo.png\",\n        link: \"/gallery/development\"\n      },\n      {\n        name: \"Design\",\n        url: \"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/projects/covers/schillaci_guitars_logo_background.jpg\",\n        link: \"/gallery/design\"\n      },\n      {\n        name: \"Illustration\",\n        url: \"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/illustrations/Aaron_Mitchell_Cogo_Labs_Halloween_Shirt.jpg\",\n        link: \"/gallery/illustration\"\n      },\n      {\n        name: \"Painting\",\n        url: \"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/paintings/Aaron_Mitchell_Painting_Reach_700.jpg\",\n        link: \"/gallery/paintings\"\n      },\n      {\n        name: \"Gig Posters\",\n        url: \"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/posters/Aaron_Mitchell_King_Gizzard_Sinclair_Cambridge.jpg\",\n        link: \"/gallery/posters\"\n      },\n      {\n        name: \"Abstract\",\n        url: \"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/projects/covers/abstract_art_cover.jpg\",\n        link: \"/gallery/circular\"\n      },\n      // {\n      //   name: \"Comics\",\n      //   url: \"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/comics/Aaron_Mitchell_She_Wore_Razor_Red.jpg\",\n      //   link: \"/gallery/comics\"\n      // },\n      {\n        name: \"Collage\",\n        url: \"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/collage/Aaron_Mitchell_Things_Fall_Apart.jpg\",\n        link: \"/gallery/collage\"\n      },\n      {\n        name: \"Photos\",\n        url: \"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/photos/Aaron_Mitchell_Boston_By_Boat.jpg\",\n        link: \"/gallery/photos\"\n      },\n    ]\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div className=\"site_wrapper site_wrapper--main\">\n          <div className=\"elevate-above-shapes\">\n            <HomeHero />\n\n            <h2>Case Studies</h2>\n            <GalleryHomeCaseStudy />\n\n            <h2 className=\"headline\">Galleries</h2>\n            <GalleryHome gallery={gallery} />\n\n            <HomeAbout />\n\n            <div className=\"Home__contact center\">\n              <h1 className=\"big-headline\">Want to talk?</h1>\n              <Link to=\"contact\">\n                <div className=\"btn btn--300 centered\">\n                  Send me a message\n                </div>\n              </Link>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <BackgroundShapes />\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/views/Home/Home.js","import React, {Component} from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n\nimport InlineImage from '../../Global/InlineImage';\n\nexport default class HomeAbout extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"HomeAbout\" id=\"HomeAbout\">\n\n        <h1>About Me</h1>\n\n        <section>\n\n          <InlineImage \n            src=\"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/portraits/aaron_mitchell_portrait_moose_almighty.jpg\"\n            position=\"right\"\n            label=\"Performing in Moose Almighty. 2020\"\n          />\n\n          <p>\n          I was born in Bangor, Maine and raised in the midcoast town of Belfast. In 2011, I graduated from the New Hampshire Institute of Art in Manchester, NH with a Bachelor of Fine Arts. I majored in Illustration, focusing on both digital skills and traditional fine art mediums such as oil painting. Since July 2012, I have been working as a professional designer in the tech industry. In the last 8 years I’ve had the opportunity to work at a small mobile marketing startup (Liquid Wireless in Portland, ME. 2012 - 2014), a venture-backed startup accelerator (Cogo Labs in Cambridge, MA. 2014 - 2017) and an international pet care marketplace (Rover in Seattle, WA. 2017 - Present). I’ve learned skills at every stage of the product development pipeline including UX/UI design, wireframing, prototyping, front-end development, user research, A/B testing, CRO, SEO, branding, entrepreneurship, idea generation and group facilitation among others. When not at work, you’ll find me building out my latest side project, or playing bass in my band Moose Almighty. \n          </p>\n\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n\n          <h2>Rover</h2>\n\n          <p>\n          I joined the pet care marketplace Rover as a Product Designer in August 2017. At Rover, I am responsible for a wide variety of tasks including UX/UI design, wireframing, prototyping, user research, creating design specs for development, leading design workshops and collaborating closely with Product Managers and Developers. I am the primary designer on the growth team as we work to maximize new bookings through CRO and SEO initiatives, although I frequently contribute to other areas of the product as well. My biggest achievement in the growth space was in my influence on how it was run and projects prioritized. <i>“... [Aaron] transformed the way the Growth PM team works with UX and approaches work … taking the Growth product space from a fairly reactive one, to a more customer focused, strategic product space.” (2019 Review)</i>\n          </p>\n\n          <InlineImage \n            src=\"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/portraits/aaron_mitchell_portrait_graffiti.jpg\"\n            position=\"left\"\n            label=\"Hosier Lane in Melbourne, Australia. 2018\"\n          />  \n\n          <p>\n          In 2019, I partnered with another designer to create a north star vision for the Rover home page. We considered current challenges such as competing business objectives along with future needs Rover would have as we added new services and moved into international markets. We conducted an intensive research phase that included 13 stakeholder interviews, competitor analysis, user testing the current home page and building scenario maps to identify existing issues and opportunities. We led a design workshop to sketch concepts, and conducted 56 user tests to reach our final vision. The first wave of updates based on the redesign were launched in January 2020. The mobile homepage won handily, reducing bounce by 9% and increasing homepage to search by 3%. <i>“… the Homepage Vision work was an excellent demonstration of your ability to take on an ambiguous, extra-large size project, keep it on track, and deliver results, even without PM support for most of the effort. ” (2019 Review)</i> \n          </p>\n          <p>\n          Other notable projects I have worked on include designing a new experience for unauthenticated users on our mobile apps, numerous CRO improvements to our search and sitter profile pages, redesigning our careers page, and adding the ability to edit a booked service on Rover which reduced operational costs of our customer service team by 30%. \n          </p>\n\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n\n          <InlineImage \n            src=\"https://blacksquare.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/portfolio/portraits/aaron_mitchell_portrait_cogo_labs.jpg\"\n            position=\"right\"\n            label=\"Cogo Labs. 2015\"\n          />  \n\n          <h2>Cogo Labs</h2>\n          <p>\n          From June 2014 to August 2017 I worked as Lead UI Designer at Cogo Labs, a startup accelerator in Cambridge, MA.

Working at a startup accelerator allowed me to contribute to lots of diverse, fast moving projects in markets such as Social Networking, Healthcare, Financial Services, Online Dating and Apartment Rentals among others. As Lead UI Designer I was also responsible for leading the design team, which involved prioritizing and assigning design tasks, mentoring junior designers and leading the hiring process for new designers.\n          </p>\n\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n\n          <h2>Liquid Wireless</h2>\n          <p>\n          From July 2012 to May 2014 I worked as a web designer for Liquid Wireless, a mobile marketing startup owned by Publishers Clearing House.

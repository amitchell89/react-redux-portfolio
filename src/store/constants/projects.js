The site features Facebook and Twitter widgets, as well as Google Analytics tracking. I also maintained Facebook and Twitter pages for the brand. For advertising I was shut out of my initial plan to advertise on Facebook due to their profanity guidelines, but did end up seeing some sales from my Facebook page, Reddit and organic traffic after the results of the election and a John Oliver segment that happened to use the same message."

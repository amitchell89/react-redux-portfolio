We decided to marry the modern tinder like dating experience with a desktop accessible web app. From there I designed a wireframe, gathered feedback and made a high fidelity mockup. I then worked worked with our engineers to build an MVP version of the site. As soon as we had a working prototype of the site we organized a user test, bringing in users between the ages of 40 and 75 into the office to demo the app, and interview them about their online dating experiences. The user testing sessions were a revelation. Besides uncovering bugs and confusing UI elements, we also learned that our ‘senior dating’ marketing message and collateral was not aligned with out user base who did not view themselves in that light. Taking this info, we updated our messaging to be more inclusive and launched. The site was active for several months and experienced decent user growth, but was eventually deprioritized due to other projects and concerns about monitoring user-generated content.
